# Hi!

This is a simple page for displaying samples of your work. I created it to be the page that exists while I'm working on a more robust portfolio-of-work site. 

You can view a live version [here](http://jllord.github.com/tempportpage)

## Its Parts

Essentially you have a two column system with images on the right and corresponding captions on the left. This scrolls behind a fixed column on the left which contains some breif bio, history and contact information. The captions of the projects are revealed above this fixed content when the page is scrolled. 

### That's all! Goodday!
